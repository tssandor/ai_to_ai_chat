# AI Dialog
Dialog between two AIs.

Make sure you have a working OpenAI API key and it's set up as an environment variable (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).

You'll need to install litellm: `pip install litellm` then `python tradewars.py`.
 
You can edit the roles and the opening message in the code and have the two AIs discuss anything.
